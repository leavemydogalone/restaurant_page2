A page for an imaginary restaurant part of the Odin Project Curriculum.

A single page web application using vanilla JS, featuring three pages.

The stylings (especially for the menu page) are extremely stark due to my lack of knowledge in css at the time of making. Will update once I have finished the rest of the curriculum of TOP.
